# Resume building with RMarkdown

I decided to try making my resume using RMarkdown. Eventually, I will also use this as an example when I get to RMarkdown on my blog.

Future versions will add in parameters. So that I can quickly generate customized resumes for different roles.

**Note:** This is my real resume, not an example file.
